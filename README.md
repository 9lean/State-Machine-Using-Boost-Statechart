# Creating State Machines Using Boost::statechart Framework (Mini eBook)

This mini eBook provides a step by step guide on using Boost::statechart (part of boost C++ library @ www.boost.org) for creating state machines based software.

A large amount of code can potentially be written in the form of state machines. Sometimes even basic switch-case statements are representation of miniature states. Many a times programmers create multiple states in the code without being explicitly aware of the fact that they are trying to emulate state machines.

__Why should one use exiting state machine framework instead of creating its own ?__

Creating a proper state machine require lots of code and should behave as expected in most of the unpredictable scenarios. One may try it out but it will take hell lot to development and testing time, which instead could be used for coding the functionality.

Boost::statechart is a generic state machine which fulfils most of the basic requirements one can find in a state machines. It my sincere opinion that one should at least explore this before deciding to write its own state machine.

__This eBook is a work in progress as of now__
