## Preface

If you're reading this preface, you must be having few question in your mind. The most probable question would be _"What the hell is this mini eBook and that too on a very small and specific topic?"_

Well, the question is valid and I'll try to justify on my position to write mini eBooks on small topics of considerable importance (in my honest opinion).

The boost library (www.boost.org) is one of the best C++ library available as of today. Its not only the best, but is a mammoth collection of helper functions for all weather problems.

Many new additions in the C++11 onwards are taken directly from the boost library (e.g Smart Pointers)

Boost has its own library documentation and boost::startchart is no exception. The official tutorial is present [here](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/statechart/doc/tutorial.html)

The official tutorial is good enough in itself. Nevertheless, I did felt the absence of something simpler which I'm trying to create as part of this mini eBook.

The intention of writing this mini eBook is to have a handy guide for anyone exploring or writing code using boost statechart library.

I've tried to most of the API(s) and scenarios of creating a descent state machine. I've deliberately spent more space in coding examples than textual explanations.

All code written here are compilable and works with most of compilers. I've tested the code in Linux, Windows & MacOS.
