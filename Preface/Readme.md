## Preface

What the hell is this mini eBook and that too on a very small topic?

Well, the question is valid and I'll try to justify on my position to write mini eBooks on small topics of considerable importance (in my honest opinion).

The boost library (www.boost.org) is one of the best C++ library available as of today. Its not only the best, but is a mamoth collection of helper functions for all weather problems.

Many new additions in the C++11 onwards are taken directly from the boost library (e.g Samrt Pointers)

Boost has its own library documentation and boost::startchart is no exception. The official tutorial is present [here](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/statechart/doc/tutorial.html)

However, while reading documentation of boost libraries, I've found a uniformity where everything was explained in similar manner. When I started working on boost statechart, I seriously missed something which I'm trying to create as part of this mini eBook.

The intention on writing this mini eBook is to have a handy guide for anyone exploring or writing code using boost statechart library.

I've covered all the API(s) and scenarios where it can be used and how it can be used. I've deliberatly spent more space in coding than textual explanations.

All code written here are compilable and works with most of compilers. I've tested the code in Linux, Windows & MacOS.
